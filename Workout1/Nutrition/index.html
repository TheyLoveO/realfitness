        <img src="images/Nutrition/Micronutrients.jpg">
        <p>Micronutrients are the essential nutrients that our bodies need in smaller amounts to function properly. They include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Vitamins - help regulate bodily functions and support growth and development.</li>
          <li>Minerals - help maintain healthy bones, teeth, and skin, and are important for many bodily functions.</li>
          <li>Water - essential for hydration, regulating body temperature, and transporting nutrients throughout the body.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It's important to eat a varied and balanced diet to ensure adequate intake of all micronutrients.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Protein</h2>
        <img src="images/Nutrition/protein.jpg">
        <p>Protein is an essential macronutrient that is important for building and repairing tissues, as well as supporting muscle growth and maintenance. Good sources of protein include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Meat, poultry, and fish</li>
          <li>Beans and legumes</li>
          <li>Eggs and dairy products</li>
          <li>Nuts and seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's important to include a variety of protein sources in your diet to ensure adequate intake of all essential amino acids.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
        <img src="images/Nutrition/carbohydrates.jpg">
        <p>Carbohydrates are an important source of energy for our bodies, and are essential for brain function. Good sources of carbohydrates include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Whole grains, such as brown rice, quinoa, and whole wheat bread</li>
          <li>Fruits and vegetables</li>
          <li>Legumes, such as beans, lentils, and chickpeas</li>
          <li>Dairy products, such as milk and yogurt</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's important to choose carbohydrates that are high in fiber and nutrients, and to avoid highly processed and sugary foods.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Fats</h2>
        <img src="images/Nutrition/realfats.jpg">
        <p>Fats are an important macronutrient that provide energy, help protect our organs, and aid in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. However, not all fats are created equal. There are several types of fats, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Saturated fats - found in animal products like meat, cheese, and butter, as well as in some plant-based oils like coconut and palm oil. Consuming too much saturated fat has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease.</li>
          <li>Trans fats - found in processed foods like margarine, snack foods, and fried foods. Trans fats are particularly harmful and should be avoided as much as possible.</li>
          <li>Monounsaturated fats - found in foods like olive oil, avocados, and nuts. These types of fats can help lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease.</li>
          <li>Polyunsaturated fats - found in foods like salmon, flaxseed, and walnuts. These types of fats are essential for brain function and can help lower inflammation in the body.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's important to choose healthy sources of fats and avoid consuming too much saturated and trans fats. Aim to include a variety of healthy fats in your diet to support overall health and wellness.</p>
